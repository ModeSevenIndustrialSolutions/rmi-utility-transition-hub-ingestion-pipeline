steam,,"FERC classification of “Steam” electric generating plants. This is occasionally reported differently for individual utilities, but typically includes “Conventional Steam Coal” and “Natural Gas Steam Turbine” technologies.",,RMI,"Asset values for these categories are remaining net plant balance for plants in service, calculated as original cost (historical capital investment) from the “Electric Plant in Service” table minus accumulated depreciation from the “Accumulated Provision for Depreciation of Electric Utility Plant” table in FERC Form 1."
nuclear,,FERC classification of “Nuclear” electric generating plants.,,RMI,
hydro,,"FERC classification of “Conventional Hydroelectric” and “Hydroelectric Pumped Storage” electric generating plants.",,RMI,
renewables,,"RMI refinement of FERC classification of “Other” electric generating plants. This category includes wind, solar, geothermal, and waste (municipal solid waste, landfill gas, waste biomass) plants.",,RMI,"Asset values for this category are remaining net plant balance for plants in service, calculated as original cost (historical capital investment) minus accumulated depreciation. Original cost values are taken from plant-level tables in FERC form 1. Accumulated depreciation values are estimated. RMI assumed that in 2004, accumulated depreciation = 0. Then depreciation in each year is calculated as original_cost * depreciation_rate, with depreciation_rate assumed to be a single constant value for each technology."
other_fossil,,"RMI refinement of FERC classification of “Other” electric generating plants. This category includes several types of gas plants (combined cycle, combustion turbine, internal combustion) all plants that use petroleum liquids for fuel, and other fossil fuel plants not included in the “steam” category.",,RMI,"Asset values for the FERC classification of “Other” plants are calculated as original cost (historical capital investment) from the “Electric Plant in Service” table minus accumulated depreciation from the “Accumulated Provision for Depreciation of Electric Utility Plant” table in FERC Form 1. Then, “other_fossil” = “Other” - “renewables”"
transmission,,FERC classification of “Transmission” plant.,,RMI,"Asset values for this category are remaining net plant balance for plants in service, calculated as original cost (historical capital investment) from the “Electric Plant in Service” table minus accumulated depreciation from the “Accumulated Provision for Depreciation of Electric Utility Plant” table in FERC Form 1."

asset_value,,Asset value,$,"FERC Form 1, RMI","RMI combined the balance sheet and balance sheet detail tables from FERC Form 1 to obtain a detailed breakdown of the balance sheet. RMI then performed a line-by-line assessment of what is or is not included in electric utility rate base, and grouped each line of the balance sheet into asset and sub_asset categories. Values are end of year values."
earnings_value,,Earnings in the given year on the asset,$,"FERC Form 1, RMI","earnings_value = asset_value*equity_ratio*ROE (see debt_equity table for equity_ratio and ROE)"
investment_value,,Investments (capital expenditure) in the given year on the asset.,$,"FERC Form 1, RMI","Directly from the “additions” field in the FERC Form 1 “Electric Plant in Service” table (thus applicable only to electric plants in service)"
