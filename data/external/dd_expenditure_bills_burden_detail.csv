steam,"FERC classification of “Steam” electric generating plants. This is occasionally reported differently for individual utilities, but typically includes “Conventional Steam Coal” and “Natural Gas Steam Turbine” technologies.",,RMI,
other_fossil,"RMI refinement of FERC classification of “Other” electric generating plants. This category includes several types of gas plants (combined cycle, combustion turbine, internal combustion) all plants that use petroleum liquids for fuel, and other fossil fuel plants not included in the “steam” category.",,RMI,"Expenditures for the FERC classification of “Other” plants are taken directly from FERC tables or calculated as described in the “component” methodology below. Then, “other_fossil” = “Other” - “renewables”"

hydro,FERC classification of “Hydraulic” electric generating plants.,,RMI,
renewables,"RMI refinement of FERC classification of “Other” electric generating plants. This category includes wind, solar, geothermal, and waste (municipal solid waste, landfill gas, waste biomass) plants.",,RMI,"Expenditures for this category are based on estimates of depreciation and operation & maintenance expenses from plant-level tables in FERC form 1, and returns using capital balances from the assets_earnings table."
