respondent_id,Utility ID from FERC,,FERC Form 1,
year,Year,,FERC Form 1,
target_type,"Identifies an emissions target as being “Voluntary”, “Mandatory” or “All”.",,RMI,“All” represents the most aggressive target within a given year.
state,State that a utility owns plants in,,EIA 860,
CO2_historical,"Historical scope 1 CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion at each utility’s owned power plants.",MMT,"EIA860, EIA923, EPA AMPD","Fuel consumption from EIA923 (in MMBTU), allocated to each generator in EIA860 (with ownership fractions for each generator from EIA860), multiplied by an emissions factor (metric tons CO2 per MMBTU) from EPA based on fuel type code, aggregated to each utility."
CO2_target,Projected Scope 1 emissions based on publicly stated targets,MMT,"EIA860, EIA923, EPA AMPD, SEPA Utility Carbon Reduction Tracker, RMI","Projected emissions in target years are calculated based on CO2_historical in the baseline year, multiplied by the fraction of emissions specified by the public target in each target year. Where a baseline year is not specified, we use 2020 as the baseline year. Because fuel consumption data from EIA is incomplete in 2000, when a baseline year of 2000 or earlier is specified, we calculate an approximate emissions baseline value using information from the utility’s corporate website."
CO2_target_all_years,"Historical Scope 1 emissions & Projected emissions based on publicly stated targets",MMT,"EIA860, EIA923, EPA AMPD, SEPA Utility Carbon Reduction Tracker","CO2_historical, CO2_target with linear interpolation between target years."
CO2_1point5C,"Projected Scope 1 emissions if the utility follows the US national-level electricity emissions trajectory from RMI’s 1.5C decarbonization analysis.",MMT,"EIA860, EIA923, EPA AMPD, RMI","RMI’s 1.5C decarbonization analysis and methodology are available here. In this dataset, we take RMI’s US national-level electricity emissions trajectory compared to 2020 levels, and scale the trajectory to each utility based on its 2020 emissions."
generation_historical,"Historical net electricity generation from each utility’s owned power plants",TWh,"EIA860, EIA923","Net electricity generation from EIA923, allocated to each generator in EIA860 (with ownership fractions for each generator from EIA860), aggregated to each utility."
generation_projected,Net electricity generation projected to future years,TWh,"EIA860, EIA923, IRPs","= generation(2020)*(1+load_cagr)^(year-2020) load_cagr is the compound annual growth rate of the utility’s electricity demand, taken from each utility’s IRP or assumed to be zero if an IRP was not available."
generation_1point5C,"Projected net electricity generation if the utility follows the US national-level net electricity generation trajectory from RMI’s 1.5C decarbonization analysis.",TWh,"EIA860, EIA923, RMI","RMI’s 1.5C decarbonization analysis and methodology are available here. In this dataset, we take RMI’s US national-level electricity net generation compared to 2020 levels, and scale the trajectory to each utility based on its 2020 emissions."
